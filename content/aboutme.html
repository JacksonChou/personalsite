title: "About Me"

<p>This site is a collection of my thoughts and projects on data science. My goal is to continously improve and grow my data science skills by applying them to different datasets.</p>
<p>My hobbies include hiking with my dog, video games, and the NBA (yes, even the offseason!)</p>
